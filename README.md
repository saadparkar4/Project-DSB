## üì± The Dhari Saad Bank Story

Once upon a time, in the bustling digital landscape of collaborative learning, two ambitious students, Dhari and Saad, embarked on a shared journey into the world of coding. Their initial steps were taken side-by-side, navigating the intricate syntax of various programming languages and the logic of problem-solving. As their individual skills blossomed, so too did their synergy as a team.

Driven by a desire to apply their newfound knowledge to a real-world challenge, they set their sights on a project that would not only test their technical prowess but also offer practical utility. They envisioned a modern banking application, one that would be intuitive, secure, and feature-rich.

With a clear vision in mind, they meticulously designed the user experience, striving for a sleek and user-friendly interface. For the underlying technology, they opted for a robust and efficient stack. They chose React Native for its ability to build cross-platform mobile applications with a single codebase, ensuring their creation would be accessible to a wide audience. To maintain code quality and scalability, TypeScript was integrated, providing type safety and enhancing developer productivity. Expo became their development tool of choice, streamlining the build process and accelerating iteration.

For efficient data fetching and state management, they leveraged TanStack React Query, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. Recognizing the importance of personalizing the banking experience, they incorporated Expo Image Picker, allowing users to easily customize their profiles. Finally, for safeguarding sensitive user information, SecureStore was implemented, guaranteeing the secure storage of credentials and other private data.

Thus, the **Dhari Saad Bank** was born ‚Äì a testament to their dedication, collaborative spirit, and mastery of modern mobile development technologies, all originating from two students who dared to learn, build, and innovate together.
